     * Problem Description
     * You are given an integer A. You have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.
     *
     * Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
     *
     * A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.
     *
     *
     *
     * Problem Constraints
     * 1 <= A <= 106
     *
     *
     *
     * Input Format
     * First and only argument contains a single positive integer A.
     *
     *
     *
     * Output Format
     * Return 1 if A is a perfect number and 0 otherwise.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example Input
     * Input 1:
     *
     * A = 4
     * Input 2:
     *
     * A = 6
     *
     *
     * Example Output
     * Output 1:
     *
     * 0
     * Output 2:
     *
     * 1
     *
     *
     * Example Explanation
     * Explanation 1:
     *
     * For A = 4, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
     * Explanation 2:
     *
     * For A = 6, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
