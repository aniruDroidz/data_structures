     * Problem Description
     * Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
     *
     * Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
     *
     * Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
     *
     * NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
     *
     *
     *
     * Problem Constraints
     * 1 <= N <= 500
     *
     * 1 <= C, B[i] <= 106
     *
     * 1 <= A[i] <= 50
     *
     *
     *
     * Input Format
     * First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
     *
     * Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
     *
     * Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.
     *
     *
     *
     * Output Format
     * Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example Input
     * Input 1:
     *
     *  A = [6, 10, 12]
     *  B = [10, 20, 30]
     *  C = 50
     * Input 2:
     *
     *  A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
     *  B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
     *  C = 10
     *
     *
     * Example Output
     * Output 1:
     *
     *  22
     * Output 2:
     *
     *  0
     *
     *
     * Example Explanation
     * Explanation 1:
     *
     *  Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 10 + 12 = 22
     * Explanation 2:
     *
     *  Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.
